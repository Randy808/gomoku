# Gomoku

Gomoku game with computer player

See in action on [Github Pages](http://SagaxTech.github.io/gomoku).

## Running the program

Even though this program is intended to be run as ClojureScript in the
browser, much of it is portable Clojure (.cljc) that can be tested
with Java-based Clojure. The following command automatically re-runs
the tests each time the code changes.

    lein test-refresh

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
